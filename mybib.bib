abstract = {The fungal cell wall building processes are the ultimate determinants of hyphal shape. In Neurospora crassa the main cell wall components, Î²-1,3-glucan and chitin, are synthesized by enzymes conveyed by specialized vesicles to the hyphal tip. These vesicles follow different secretory routes, which are delicately coordinated by cargo-specific Rab GTPases until their accumulation at the SpitzenkÃ¶rper. From there, the exocyst mediates the docking of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, where they ultimately get fused. Although significant progress has been done on the cellular mechanisms that carry cell wall synthesizing enzymes from the endoplasmic reticulum to hyphal tips, a lot of information is still missing. Here, the current knowledge on N. crassa cell wall composition and biosynthesis is presented with an emphasis on the underlying molecular and cellular secretory processes.}

The book has been substantially extended and revised in cooperation with the co-authors. Particular emphasis is given to the convergence of the implicit time discretization method and to the error estimates for this discretization, extending the well established theory in Hilbert spaces. The book is split in two main parts that can be read independently of each other.},

In particular, linear growth at infinity of the coagulation kernel is included and the initial condition may have an infinite second moment. Furthermore, all weak solutions (in a suitable sense) including the ones constructed herein are shown to be mass-conserving, a property which was proved in Norris (1999) under stronger assumptions. The existence proof relies on a weak compactness method in               L               1               and a by-product of the analysis is that both conservative and non-conservative approximations to the SCE lead to weak solutions which are then mass-conserving.},

  abstract = {Mean field games are concerned with the limit of large-population stochastic differential games where the agents interact through their empirical distribution. In the classical setting, the number of players is large but fixed throughout the game. However, in various applications, such as population dynamics or economic growth, the number of players can vary across time and this may lead to different Nash equilibria. In order to account for this evolution, we introduce a branching mechanism in the population of agents and obtain a variant of the original mean field game problem. As a first step, we study a simple model using a PDE approach to illustrate the main differences with the classical setting. We prove existence of a solution and show that it provides an approximate Nash-equilibrium for large population games. We also present a numerical example for a linear--quadratic model. Then we study the problem in a general setting by a probabilistic approach. It is based upon the relaxed formulation of stochastic control problems which allows us to obtain a general existence result.},

The advantage we take on this is that we can perform an unified study for both continuous and discrete models. The integro-partial-differential equation satisfied by \${\textbackslash}\{Q\_t{\textbackslash}\}\_\{t{\textbackslash}geq 0\}\$ can be interpreted as the evolution equation of the time marginals of a Markov pure jump process. At this end we introduce a nonlinear Poisson driven stochastic differential equation related to the Smoluchowski equation in the following way: if \$X\_t\$ satisfies this stochastic equation, then the law of \$X\_t\$ satisfies the modified Smoluchowski equation. The nonlinear process is richer than the Smoluchowski equation, since it provides historical information on the particles. Existence, uniqueness and pathwise behavior for the solution of this SDE are studied. Finally, we prove that the nonlinear process X can be obtained as the limit of a Marcus-Lushnikov procedure.},

It illustrates the use of the general theories and introduces readers to other branches of analysis such as Fourier analysis, distribution theory, and probability theory.  This edition is bolstered in content as well as in scope-extending its usefulness to students outside of pure analysis as well as those interested in dynamical systems. The numerous exercises, extensive bibliography, and review chapter on sets and metric spaces make Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications, Second Edition invaluable for students in graduate-level analysis courses. New features include: * Revised material on the n-dimensional Lebesgue integral. * An improved proof of Tychonoff's theorem. * Expanded material on Fourier analysis. * A newly written chapter devoted to distributions and differential equations. * Updated material on Hausdorff dimension and fractal dimension.},

  abstract = {We introduce a general class of coagulation models, where clusters of given types may coagulate in more than one way and where the rate at which this happens may depend on the cluster types. In the continuum version of these models there is a generalization of Smoluchowski's coagulation equation. We introduce a notion of strong solution for this equation and prove the existence of a maximal strong solution, which while it persists is the only solution. When the total rate of coagulation for particles is bounded above and below by constant multiples of the product of their masses, we show that the maximal strong solution coincides with the maximal mass-conserving solution and does not persist for all time.  Thus, for these models, loss of mass (to infinity) coincides with divergence of the second moment of the mass distribution and takes place in a finite time. When the total rate of coagulation of large particles is proportional to their masses, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for all time.  In a restricted class of ``polymer'' models, we allow coagulation of weighted shapes in a finite number of ways.  For this class we establish a discrete approximation scheme for the continuum dynamics.},
