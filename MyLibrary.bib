	abstract = {Filamentous fungi are highly polarized eukaryotic cells, which continuously elongate their hyphae at the tips. The extension of hyphal tips requires the continuous enlargement of the cell membrane and the extension of the cell wall. Both are achieved through massive vesicle fusion at the tip. Vesicle transport as well as all other dynamic processes related to polar growth, such as organelle duplication and distribution, or the transport of RNA, proteins, or lipids, requires cytoskeletal elements. The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in fungi—as in higher eukaryotes—requires the interplay between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and landmark proteins at the cortex. Here we review recent findings unraveling the mechanism of polarized growth with special emphasis on the roles of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, polarity markers linking the two cytoskeletons.},

	abstract = {Most fungi have multiple chitin synthases (CSs) that may make chitin at different sites on the cell surface, at different times during growth, and in response to cell wall stress. The structure-based model for CS function is for transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane to the non-reducing end of a growing chitin chain, which is concomitantly translocated through a transmembrane channel formed by the synthase. Two aspects of CS mechanism are investigated: how chains might be initiated, and what governs how long they can get. First, it is shown that CSs incorporate free GlcNAc into di-N-acetylchitobiose and into insoluble chitin in a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent manner, and therefore that GlcNAc primes chitin synthesis. Second, average lengths of insoluble chitin chains were measured by determining the molar ratio of priming GlcNAc to chain-extending, UDP-GlcNAc-derived GlcNAc, and showed dependence on UDP-GlcNAc concentration, approaching a maximum at higher concentrations of substrate. These results, together with previous findings that 2-acylamido GlcN analogues prime formation of chitin oligosaccharides and stimulate chitin synthesis are discussed in the context of the structure-based model, and lead to the following proposals. 1) CSs may “self-prime” by hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc to yield GlcNAc. 2) A CS’s active site is not continuously occupied by a nascent chitin chain, rather, CSs can release chitin chains, then re-initiate, and therefore synthesize chitin chains in bursts. 3) The length of chitin chains made by a given CS will impact that CS’s contribution to construction of the fungal cell wall.},

In addition, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments allowed identifying two types of self-adhering subpopulations (the so-called “bald” and “hairy” cells) and revealed changes in their relative populations with the bacterial culture age and the protocol of preparation. We indeed observed a dramatic evanescing of the “hairy” subpopulation for samples that underwent centrifugation and resuspension processes. When examined by AFM, the “hairy” cell surface resembled to a herringbone structure characterized by upper structural units with lateral dimensions of ∼70 nm and a high Young modulus value (∼2.3 MPa), a mean depth of the trough between them of ∼15 nm and a resulting roughness of ∼5 nm. By contrast, the “bald” cells appeared much softer (∼0.35 MPa) with a roughness one order of magnitude lower. We observed too the gradual detachment of the herringbone patterns from the “hairy” bacterial envelope of cell harvested from a 16 h old culture and their progressive accumulation between the bacteria in the form of globular clusters. The secretion of a soft extracellular polymeric substance was also identified that, in addition to the globular clusters, may contribute to the initiation of the biofilm spatial organization.},

	abstract = {The roles of the thicknesses and grafting densities of the surface biopolymers of four multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli bacterial strains that varied in their biofilm formation in controlling cellular elasticities after exposure to ampicillin were investigated using atomic force microscopy. Exposure to ampicillin was carried out at minimum inhibitory concentrations for different duration times. Our results indicated that the four strains resisted ampicillin through variable mechanisms. Strain A5 did not change its cellular properties upon exposure to ampicillin and as such resisted ampicillin through dormancy. Strain H5 increased its biopolymer brush thickness, adhesion and biofilm formation and kept its roughness, surface area and cell elasticity unchanged upon exposure to ampicillin. As such, this strain likely limits the diffusion of ampicillin by forming strong biofilms. At three hours’ exposure to ampicillin, strains D4 and A9 increased their roughness, surface areas, biofilm formation, and brush thicknesses and decreased their elasticities. Therefore, at short exposure times to ampicillin, these strains resisted ampicillin through forming strong biofilms that impede ampicillin diffusion. At eight hours’ exposure to ampicillin, strains D4 and A9 collapsed their biopolymers, increased their apparent grafting densities and increased their cellular elasticities. Therefore, at long exposure times to ampicillin, cells utilized their higher rigidity to reduce the diffusion of ampicillin into the cells. The findings of this study clearly point to the potential of using the nanoscale characterization of MDR bacterial properties as a means to monitor cell modifications that enhance “phenotypic antibiotic resistance”.},

These vesicles follow different secretory routes, which are delicately coordinated by cargo-specific Rab GTPases until their accumulation at the Spitzenkörper. From there, the exocyst mediates the docking of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, where they ultimately get fused. Although significant progress has been done on the cellular mechanisms that carry cell wall synthesizing enzymes from the endoplasmic reticulum to hyphal tips, a lot of information is still missing. Here, the current knowledge on N. crassa cell wall composition and biosynthesis is presented with an emphasis on the underlying molecular and cellular secretory processes.},

Accordingly, their glucose moieties may be joined through either or both alpha (α) or beta (β) linkages, they are either lineal or branched, and amorphous or microfibrillar. Alpha 1,3 glucans sensu strictu (pseudonigerans) are the most abundant alpha glucans present in the cell walls of fungi, being restricted to dikarya. They exist in the form of structural microfibrils that provide resistance to the cell wall. The structure of beta glucans is more complex. They are linear or branched, and contain mostly β 1,3 and β 1,6 linkages, existing in the form of microfibrils. Together with chitin they constitute the most important structural components of fungal cell walls. They are the most abundant components of the cell walls in members of all fungal phyla, with the exception of Microsporidia, where they are absent. Taking into consideration the importance of glucans in the structure and physiology of the fungi, in the present review we describe the following aspects of these polysaccharides: i) types and distribution of fungal glucans, ii) their structure, iii) their roles, iv) the mechanism of synthesis of the most important ones, and v) the phylogentic relationships of the enzymes involved in their synthesis.},

	abstract = {The rodlet structure present on the Aspergillus fumigatus conidial surface hides conidia from immune recognition. In spite of the essential biological role of the rodlets, the molecular basis for their self-assembly and disaggregation is not known. Analysis of the soluble forms of conidia-extracted and recombinant RodA by NMR spectroscopy has indicated the importance of disulfide bonds and identified two dynamic regions as likely candidates for conformational change and intermolecular interactions during conversion of RodA into the amyloid rodlet structure. Point mutations introduced into the RODA sequence confirmed that (1) mutation of a single cysteine was sufficient to block rodlet formation on the conidial surface and (2) both presumed amyloidogenic regions were needed for proper rodlet assembly. Mutations in the two putative amyloidogenic regions retarded and disturbed, but did not completely inhibit, the formation of the rodlets in vitro and on the conidial surface. Even in a disturbed form, the presence of rodlets on the surface of the conidia was sufficient to immunosilence the conidium. However, in contrast to the parental conidia, long exposure of mutant conidia lacking disulfide bridges within RodA or expressing RodA carrying the double (I115S/I146G) mutation activated dendritic cells with the subsequent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The immune reactivity of the RodA mutant conidia was not due to a modification in the RodA structure, but to the exposure of different pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the surface as a result of the modification of the rodlet surface layer. The full degradation of the rodlet layer, which occurs during early germination, is due to a complex array of cell wall bound proteases. As reported earlier, this loss of the rodlet layer lead to a strong anti-fumigatus host immune response in mouse lungs.},

Bacterial adhesion is an important first step in the formation of biofilms, the control of which is relevant to industries that include shipping, water purification, packaging, and biomedical devices. However, many questions remain unanswered in the bacterial adhesion process, despite extensive research in this area. With QCM-D, multiple variables affecting bacterial adhesion can be studied, including the roles of substrate composition, chemical modification, solution ionic strength, environmental temperature, shear conditions, and time. Recent studies demonstrate the utility of QCM-D in developing new bacterial adhesion models and studying different stages of biofilm formation. We provide a review of how QCM-D has been used to study bacterial adhesion at stages ranging from the first step of bacterial adhesion to mature biofilms, and how QCM-D studies are being used to promote the development of solutions to biofilm formation.},

	abstract = {The fungal cell wall is the first point of contact between fungal pathogens and host organisms. It serves as a protective barrier against biotic and abiotic stresses and as a signal to the host that a fungal pathogen is present. The fungal cell wall is made predominantly of carbohydrates and glycoproteins, many of which serve as binding receptors for host defence molecules or activate host immune responses through interactions with membrane-bound receptors. Plant defensins are a large family of cationic antifungal peptides that protect plants against fungal disease. Binding of the plant defensin NaD1 to the fungal cell wall has been described but the specific component of the cell wall with which this interaction occurred was unknown. The effect of binding was also unclear, that is whether the plant defensin used fungal cell wall components as a recognition motif for the plant to identify potential pathogens or if the cell wall acted to protect the fungus against the defensin. Here we describe the interaction between the fungal cell wall polysaccharides chitin and β-glucan with NaD1 and other plant defensins. We discovered that the β-glucan layer protects the fungus against plant defensins and the loss of activity experienced by many cationic antifungal peptides at elevated salt concentrations is due to sequestration by fungal cell wall polysaccharides. This has limited the development of cationic antifungal peptides for the treatment of systemic fungal diseases in humans as the level of salt in serum is enough to inactivate most cationic peptides.},

	abstract = {The yeast cell wall is composed of mannoproteins, β-1,3/β-1, 6-glucans and chitin. Each of these components has technological properties that are relevant for industrial and medical applications. To address issues related to cell wall structure and alteration in response to stress or conditioning processes, AFM dendritips were functionalized with biomolecules that are specific for each of the wall components, which was wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for chitin, concanavalin A (ConA) for mannans and anti-β-1,3/anti-β-1,6-glucan antibodies for β-1,3/β-1,6-glucans. Binding specificity of these biomolecules were validated using penta-N-acetylchitopentaose, α-mannans, laminarin (short β-1,3-glucan chain) and gentiobiose (2 glucose units linked in β 1→6) immobilized on epoxy glass slides. Dynamic force spectroscopy was employed to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic information on the intermolecular interaction of the binary complexes using the model of Friddle-Noy-de Yoreo. Using this model, transition state distance xt, dissociate rate koff and the lowest force (feq) required to break the intermolecular bond of the complexes were approximated. These functionalized dendritips were then used to probe the yeast cell surface treated with a bacterial protease. As expected, this treatment, which removed the outer layer of the cell wall, gave accessibility to the inner layer composed of β-glucans. Likewise, bud scars were nicely localized using AFM dendritip bearing the WGA probe. To conclude, these functionalized AFM dendritips constitute a new toolbox that can be used to investigate cell surface structure and organization in response to a wide arrays of cultures and process conditions.},

In this study an in vitro system utilizing n-hexacosanal, a constituent of the barley cuticle and known inducer of Bgh germination, was used to cultivate Bgh and differentiate conidia up to the appressorial germ tube stage for analysis. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the appressorial germ tube stage revealed that there was a significant shift towards energy and protein production during the pre-penetrative phase of development, with an up-regulation of enzymes associated with cellular respiration and protein synthesis, modification and transport. Glycosidic linkage analysis of the cell wall polysaccharides demonstrated that during appressorial development an increase in 1,3- and 1,4-linked glucosyl residues and xylosyl residues was detected along with a significant decrease in galactosyl residues. The use of this in vitro cultivation method demonstrates that it is possible to analyse the pre-penetrative processes of Bgh development in the absence of a plant host.},

	abstract = {Infection of barley with the powdery mildew causal agent, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), can lead to devastating damage to barley crops. The recent emergence of fungicide resistance imposes a need to develop new antifungal strategies. The enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis are ideal targets for the development of fungicides. However, in order to narrow down any target proteins involved in cell wall formation, a greater understanding of the cell wall structure and composition is required. Here, we present a detailed carbohydrate analysis of the Bgh conidial cell wall, a full annotation of Carbohydrate Active enZymes (CAZy) in the Bgh genome, and a comprehensive expression profile of the genes involved in cell wall metabolism. Glycosidic linkage analysis has revealed that the cell wall polysaccharide fraction of Bgh conidia predominantly consists of glucosyl residues (63.1\%) and has a greater proportion of galactopyranosyl residues compared to other species (8.5\%). Trace amounts of xylosyl residues were also detected, which is unusual in ascomycetes. Transcripts of the genes involved in cell wall metabolism show high expression of chitin deacetylases, which assist fungi in evading the host defence system by deacetylating chitin to chitosan. The data presented suggest that the cell wall components of the conidia and the corresponding obligate biotrophic CAZy gene profile play a key role in the infection process.},

	abstract = {Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) signalling affects several cellular processes in Bacillus cereus group bacteria including biofilm formation and motility, and CdgF was previously identified as a diguanylate cyclase promoting biofilm formation in B. thuringiensis. C-di-GMP can exert its function as a second messenger via riboswitch binding, and a functional c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitch has been found upstream of cbpA in various B. cereus group strains. Protein signature recognition predicted CbpA to be a cell wall-anchored surface protein with a fibrinogen or collagen binding domain. The aim of this study was to identify the binding ligand of CbpA and the function of CbpA in cellular processes that are part of the B. cereus group c-di-GMP regulatory network. By global gene expression profiling cbpA was found to be down-regulated in a cdgF deletion mutant, and cbpA exhibited maximum expression in early exponential growth. Contrary to the wild type, a ΔcbpA deletion mutant showed no binding to collagen in a cell adhesion assay, while a CbpA overexpression strain exhibited slightly increased collagen binding compared to the control. For both fibrinogen and fibronectin there was however no change in binding activity compared to controls, and CbpA did not appear to contribute to binding to abiotic surfaces (polystyrene, glass, steel). Also, the CbpA overexpression strain appeared to be less motile and showed a decrease in biofilm formation compared to the control. This study provides the first experimental proof that the binding ligand of the c-di-GMP regulated adhesin CbpA is collagen.},

In this study, extensin occurrence in cotton fibres was assessed using carbohydrate immunomicroarrays, mass spectrometry and monosaccharide profiling. Extensin amounts in three species appeared to correlate with fibre quality. Fibre cell expression profiling of the four cotton cultivars, combined with extensin arabinoside chain length measurements during fibre development, demonstrated that arabinoside side-chain length is modulated during development.

For the rate constantK(i, j) in Smoluchowski's equation, we make the very general assumption thatK(i, j) is a homogeneous function of the cluster sizesi andj:K(i,j)=a−λK(ai,aj) for alla{\textgreater}0, but we restrict ourselves to kernels satisfyingK(i, j)/j→0 asj→∞. We show that gelation occurs ifλ{\textgreater}1, and does not occur ifλ⩽1. For all gelling and nongelling models, we calculate the time dependence ofs(t), and we derive an equation forϕ(x). We present a detailed analysis of the behavior ofϕ(x) at large and small values ofx. For all models, we find exponential large-x behavior: ϕ(x)∼Ax−λe−δxasx→∞ and, for different kernelsK(i, j), algebraic or exponential small-x behavior: ϕ(x)∼Bx−τ or ϕ(x)=exp(−Cx−{\textbar}μ{\textbar} + ...) asx↓0.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider coagulation processes in large but finite systems, and study the time-dependent behavior of the (nonequilibrium) fluctuations in the cluster size distribution. For this purpose we apply van Kampen'sΩ-expansion to a master equation describing coagulation processes, and derive an approximate (Fokker-Planck) equation for the probability distribution of the fluctuations. First we consider two exactly soluble models, corresponding to the choicesK(i, j) =i + jandK(i, j)=1 for the rate constants in the Fokker-Planck equation. For these models and monodisperse initial conditions we calculate the probability distribution of the fluctuations and the equal-time and two-time correlation functions. For general initial conditions we study the behavior of the fluctuations at large cluster sizes, and in the scaling limit. Next we consider, in general, homogeneous rate constants, with the propertyK(i, j) =a-λK(ai,aj)for alla{\textgreater}0, and we give asymptotic expressions for the equal-time correlation functions at large cluster sizes, and in the scaling limit. In the scaling limit we find that the fluctuations show relatively simple scaling behavior for all homogeneous rate constantsK(i, j).},

	abstract = {We introduce a general class of coagulation models, where clusters of given types may coagulate in more than one way and where the rate at which this happens may depend on the cluster types. In the continuum version of these models there is a generalization of Smoluchowski's coagulation equation. We introduce a notion of strong solution for this equation and prove the existence of a maximal strong solution, which while it persists is the only solution. When the total rate of coagulation for particles is bounded above and below by constant multiples of the product of their masses, we show that the maximal strong solution coincides with the maximal mass-conserving solution and does not persist for all time.  Thus, for these models, loss of mass (to infinity) coincides with divergence of the second moment of the mass distribution and takes place in a finite time. When the total rate of coagulation of large particles is proportional to their masses, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for all time.  In a restricted class of “polymer” models, we allow coagulation of weighted shapes in a finite number of ways.  For this class we establish a discrete approximation scheme for the continuum dynamics.},

	abstract = {We study an individual-based stochastic spatial epidemic model where the number of locations and the number of individuals at each location both grow to infinity. Each individual is associated with a random infection-age dependent infectivity function. Individuals are infected through interactions across the locations with heterogeneous effects. The epidemic dynamics can be described using a time-space representation for the the total force of infection, the number of susceptible individuals, the number of infected individuals that are infected at each time and have been infected for a certain amount of time, as well as the number of recovered individuals. We prove a functional law of large numbers for these time-space processes, and in the limit, we obtain a set of time-space integral equations. We then derive the PDE models from the limiting time-space integral equations, in particular, the density (with respect to the infection age) of the time-age-space integral equation for the number of infected individuals tracking the age of infection satisfies a linear PDE in time and age with an integral boundary condition. These integral equation and PDE limits can be regarded as dynamics on graphon under certain conditions.},

In particular, linear growth at infinity of the coagulation kernel is included and the initial condition may have an infinite second moment. Furthermore, all weak solutions (in a suitable sense) including the ones constructed herein are shown to be mass-conserving, a property which was proved in Norris (1999) under stronger assumptions. The existence proof relies on a weak compactness method in L 1 and a by-product of the analysis is that both conservative and non-conservative approximations to the SCE lead to weak solutions which are then mass-conserving.},

In the classical setting, the number of players is large but fixed throughout the game. However, in various applications, such as population dynamics or economic growth, the number of players can vary across time and this may lead to different Nash equilibria. In order to account for this evolution, we introduce a branching mechanism in the population of agents and obtain a variant of the original mean field game problem. As a first step, we study a simple model using a PDE approach to illustrate the main differences with the classical setting. We prove existence of a solution and show that it provides an approximate Nash-equilibrium for large population games. We also present a numerical example for a linear–quadratic model. Then we study the problem in a general setting by a probabilistic approach. It is based upon the relaxed formulation of stochastic control problems which allows us to obtain a general existence result.},

The advantage we take on this is that we can perform an unified study for both continuous and discrete models. The integro-partial-differential equation satisfied by \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textbackslash\{Q\_t{\textbackslash}textbackslash\}\_\{t{\textbackslash}textbackslashgeq 0\}{\textbackslash} can be interpreted as the evolution equation of the time marginals of a Markov pure jump process. At this end we introduce a nonlinear Poisson driven stochastic differential equation related to the Smoluchowski equation in the following way: if {\textbackslash}X\_t{\textbackslash} satisfies this stochastic equation, then the law of {\textbackslash}X\_t{\textbackslash} satisfies the modified Smoluchowski equation. The nonlinear process is richer than the Smoluchowski equation, since it provides historical information on the particles. Existence, uniqueness and pathwise behavior for the solution of this SDE are studied. Finally, we prove that the nonlinear process X can be obtained as the limit of a Marcus-Lushnikov procedure.},

In this paper we prove the existence of such self-similar solutions for continuous kernels K that are homogeneous of degree {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma {\textbackslash}textbackslashin (-{\textbackslash}textbackslashinfty,1)\}{\textbackslash}and satisfy K(x, y) łeq C (xγ + yγ). More precisely, for any {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrho {\textbackslash}textbackslashin ({\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma,1)\}{\textbackslash}we establish the existence of a continuous weak nonnegative self-similar profile with decay {\textbackslash}\{xˆ\{-(1\{+\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashrho)\}\}{\textbackslash}as x {\textbackslash}rightarrow ınfty.},
